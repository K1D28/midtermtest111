# Specification Kit

## System Context
The Simple Notes App is a lightweight web-based application that allows users to quickly jot down notes. It is designed to be used locally without requiring a backend or user authentication.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Add Notes**: Users can add a note by providing a title and content.
2. **View Notes**: Users can view all notes in a list, displayed in reverse chronological order.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The app should provide instant feedback when saving a note.
2. **Persistence**: Notes should persist between sessions using local storage.
3. **Usability**: The UI should be minimal, responsive, and intuitive.

## User Stories
1. **As a user, I want to add a note with a title and content so that I can save important information.**
2. **As a user, I want to view all my notes in reverse chronological order so that I can see the most recent notes first.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Add Notes**:
   - Given the user enters a title and content, when they click the "Add Note" button, then the note should be saved to local storage and displayed in the notes list.
   - The form should reset after a successful submission.
   - Empty titles or content should not be allowed.

2. **View Notes**:
   - Given the user opens the application, when notes are loaded from local storage, then all notes should be displayed in reverse chronological order.

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - The application should be fully functional and visually appealing on devices with screen widths ranging from 320px to 1920px.
