# Specification Kit

## System Context
The Notes App is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, and manage notes. The system interacts with a backend API to store and retrieve notes. The primary components of the system include:
- **Frontend**: A user interface for creating and viewing notes.
- **Backend API**: A server-side application that handles storing and retrieving notes.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Create Notes**: Users can create a note by providing a title and content.
2. **View Notes**: Users can view a list of all notes, including their titles, content, and timestamps.
3. **Persist Notes**: Notes are stored on the server and persist across sessions.
4. **Fetch Notes**: The application fetches notes from the backend API and displays them in the UI.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The application should load and display notes within 2 seconds after fetching from the server.
2. **Scalability**: The backend should handle up to 100 concurrent users.
3. **Usability**: The UI should be intuitive and responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Security**: The application should validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities.

## User Stories
1. **As a user, I want to create a new note so that I can save important information.**
2. **As a user, I want to view all my notes so that I can quickly access saved information.**
3. **As a user, I want to see the timestamp of each note so that I know when it was created.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Create Notes**:
   - Given the user enters a title and content in the form, when they click the "Add Note" button, then the note should be saved to the server and displayed in the notes list.
   - The form should reset after a successful submission.

2. **View Notes**:
   - Given the user opens the application, when the notes are fetched from the server, then all notes should be displayed in the notes list with their titles, content, and timestamps.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the server is unreachable, an error message should be displayed to the user.
   - If the user submits an empty title or content, the form should display a validation error.

4. **Responsiveness**:
   - The application should be fully functional and visually appealing on devices with screen widths ranging from 320px to 1920px.
