# Project Constitution

## Principles

### 1. Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Follow established coding standards and conventions.
- Ensure proper documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.

### 2. Testing Standards
- Maintain a high level of test coverage for all critical components.
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as appropriate.
- Ensure all tests pass before merging code into the main branch.

### 3. User Experience Consistency
- Prioritize intuitive and user-friendly design.
- Maintain consistency in UI/UX across all components and platforms.
- Regularly gather and incorporate user feedback to improve usability.

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Optimize code for efficiency and scalability.
- Minimize resource usage (CPU, memory, network) without compromising functionality.
- Regularly monitor and address performance bottlenecks.

### 5. Data Persistence and Local-First Design
- Ensure data is stored locally to allow offline usage.
- Use lightweight and fast storage mechanisms like local storage or a simple database.
- Extend to file-based storage for backend persistence.
